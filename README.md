#### Name and describe 2 distinct business models/use cases that would require auth and then capture at a later time.

##### Pre-authorizing a higher amount to mitigate fraud or insufficient funds
Example: EV charging stations often authorize a larger amount upfront before the session begins, since the final cost depends on usage and cannot be determined until the session ends. This ensures that sufficient funds are available and reduces payment failures after the transaction.

##### Holding a deposit prior to fulfillment to secure commitment
Example: Hotels or B2B order placements may authorize a deposit or the full estimated amount at the time of booking. The actual charge is captured only after the stay or once the goods are shipped, ensuring payment while allowing for fulfillment flexibility.
